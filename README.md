Diabetes Dataset Analysis

This repository contains code for analyzing a diabetes dataset, focusing on logistic regression to predict the probability of diabetes based on glucose levels and age. It also includes code to visualize the decision threshold.

Overview

The primary objective of this project is to analyze the diabetes dataset and predict the likelihood of diabetes based on glucose levels and age using logistic regression. The project also demonstrates how to calculate and visualize the decision threshold where the predicted probability of diabetes is 0.5.Overview

This project aims to analyze and predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on glucose levels and age using a logistic regression model. The primary focus is on building an accurate model that can provide probabilistic predictions and visualizing the decision boundary to understand the relationship between the input features and the outcome.

The key objectives of this project are:

Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Handling Missing and Zero Values: Utilizing Pandas and NumPy to identify and handle missing or zero values in the dataset.
Filling Missing Values: Replacing missing or zero values with the mean of the respective columns to ensure the data is suitable for modeling.

Model Training:
Training a logistic regression model using the Glucose and Age features to predict the Outcome (whether a patient has diabetes or not).
Probability Prediction:

Generating a range of glucose values to predict the probability of diabetes while keeping the age constant at its mean value.
Using the trained logistic regression model to compute these probabilities.
Threshold Calculation:

Calculating the decision boundary or threshold where the probability of diabetes is 0.5.
Understanding how this threshold can help in classifying patients based on their glucose levels.

Visualization:
Creating visualizations to plot the predicted probabilities against glucose levels.
Adding a vertical line to indicate the decision threshold, providing a clear visual representation of the model's decision-making process.
Technologies and Libraries Used
Pandas: For data manipulation, handling missing values, and preprocessing.
NumPy: For numerical operations and handling missing data.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the logistic regression model.
Matplotlib: For creating visualizations to understand the data and model predictions.
By achieving these objectives, this project provides a comprehensive analysis of the diabetes dataset, offering insights into the relationship between glucose levels, age, and the likelihood of diabetes. The results and visualizations can be used to make informed decisions in a healthcare setting or for further research and development in predictive modeling and medical data analysis.

Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the application of logistic regression to predict the probability of diabetes based on glucose levels and age. Through detailed data cleaning, manipulation, and handling of missing values using Pandas and NumPy, we prepared a robust dataset suitable for modeling..
